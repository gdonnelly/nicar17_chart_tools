# Charts with Datawrapper
Whether you want a way to make your own simple charts or a tool to empower the rest of the newsroom (so you can work on other data projects), <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">Datawrapper</a> is a good way to create a variety of graphics with a consistent style.

Make a Datawrapper account. These are free unless you want to customize the template for your organization. 

1st- Upload your data. You can just copy/paste your data or upload a csv

Some tips for data formatting: 
    Strip out dollar signs, commas, etc, 
    dates should be mm-dd-yyyy to make sure DW will play nicely with them
    it's easiest to only upload what needs to go in your chart. It’s going to look sort of messy, don’t worry you’ll have the opportunity to check/fix it

2nd- Check & describe your data: there's a checkbox to mark first row as labels. Select each column to mark it as text/numbers. Preppend/Append symbols ($, %). Hide any columns you don't want to visualize.

3rd- Visualize: Choose the type of chart you want. Add labels, notes and source info. Adjust colors, size, style.
  
4th- Publish: You can either embed the interactive graphic in an iframe or save out a .png.
